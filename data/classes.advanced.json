    "description": "Engineers form an integral component of the Union, the grease that keeps our Mechs and Crawlers trundling across the great wastelands. They can take apart and put back together a Mech Chassis in the blink of an eye, and keep their salvage crew operational out in the wastes. Choose an Engineer if you want a character with a breadth of engineering and mechanical knowledge; who can repair and support you and your allies' Mechs, mount Mech parts significantly faster, and allow you to craft Mech parts in the field.",

    "description": "Electronic warfare is a reality of the world we live in, and Hackers are at the forefront, delving into the cybersphere to discover new and ingenious ways to hack into Mech infrastructure, tap into corpo networks, and use corpo tech against their owners. Hackers are constantly experimenting with new ways to craft Mech components, and many augment their bodies with a range of modifications, finding their flesh as dull as a long system update. Choose a Hacker if you want access to specialised hacking Abilities, to play a character with a wide range of knowledge about technology, or are interested in augmenting your character beyond the flesh.",

    "source": "Salvage Union Workshop Manual",
    "description": "If you need a job done in the Union, no matter how dirty, you call a Hauler. There is never a job too big, or a deal too messy, that they wonâ€™t shake your hand with a smile to do. Whether it is hauling a leaky reactor through a hot zone or salvaging from a buried arco in a toxic waste dump. This can-do attitude makes them a shoo-in for leadership roles, as other salvagers look up to them for their sheer tenacity. Play a Hauler if you want to play a hardy character who can haul large amounts of cargo, make tough deals, and protect and inspire their allies.",

    "source": "Salvage Union Workshop Manual",
    "description": "The wasteland is a vast, hostile, and unforgiving expanse; and the Scout knows that land from end to end. Without their guidance, our Mechs and Crawlers would be lost in the wastes, prey to raider ambushes, rad storms, and mutated beast attacks. A Scout's knowledge of the wastes extends beyond the natural, allowing them to infiltrate wasteland sites and corpo settlements and bases. Play a Scout if you want Abilities that allow you to snipe at your enemies, perform tracking and reconnaissance in the wastes, and infiltrate protected areas.",

    "description": "War and conflict is an ever present factor in the wastelands and whether fighting with sharpened sticks or plasma cannons, soldiers have always been at the forefront of a conflict throughout human history. Union Soldiers join from many avenues of life. Some are veterans of past wars, some are wastelanders who have earned their stripes by simply surviving out there, others defect from corpo merc life to the better one the Unions can provide. What they all have in common is a desire to fight for the Salvage Union which has provided them and their community with so much. Play a Soldier if you want to play a combat focused character who can blow things up, engage in brutal melee combat, and survive out in the hostile wastes.",
