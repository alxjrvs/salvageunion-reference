Stefanus Corporation commissioned Noel Sküm, a populist tech mogul, to develop clean energy reactors that would fuel the vast mainframes within their home arco. Instead, he used the funds to build the 'EM-28' Photon, which whilst flashy and powerful was expensive, over designed and failed to gain mass adoption. When the venture with Sküm failed, the Stefanus Corporation instead moved their home arco to the frozen Forgotten Tundra.",
