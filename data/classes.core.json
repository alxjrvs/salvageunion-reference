    "description": "Engineers form an integral component of the Union, the grease that keeps our Mechs and Crawlers trundling across the great wastelands. They can take apart and put back together a Mech Chassis in the blink of an eye, and keep their salvage crew operational out in the wastes. Choose an Engineer if you want a character with a breadth of engineering and mechanical knowledge; who can repair and support you and your allies' Mechs, mount Mech parts significantly faster, and allow you to craft Mech parts in the field. Engineers can advance into the Fabricator p. 62 or Union Rep Class p. 74, or focus their talents and take Abilities from the Advanced Engineer Tree p. 30.",

    "description": "Electronic warfare is a reality of the world we live in, and Hackers are at the forefront, delving into the cybersphere to discover new and ingenious ways to hack into Mech infrastructure, tap into corpo networks, and use corpo tech against their owners. Hackers are constantly experimenting with new ways to craft Mech components, and many augment their bodies with a range of modifications, finding their flesh as dull as a long system update. Choose a Hacker if you want access to specialised hacking Abilities, to play a character with a wide range of knowledge about technology, or are interested in augmenting your character beyond the flesh. Hackers can advance into the Cyborg p. 58 or Fabricator p. 62 Classes, or focus their talents and take Abilities from the Advanced Hacker Tree p. 36.",

    "description": "If you need a job done in the Union, no matter how dirty, you call a Hauler. There is never a job too big, or a deal too messy, that they wonâ€™t shake your hand with a smile to do. Whether it is hauling a leaky reactor through a hot zone or salvaging from a buried arco in a toxic waste dump. This can-do attitude makes them a shoo-in for leadership roles, as other salvagers look up to them for their sheer tenacity. Play a Hauler if you want to play a hardy character who can haul large amounts of cargo, make tough deals, and protect and inspire their allies. The Hauler can advance into the Union Rep p. 74 or Smuggler p. 70 Classes or focus their skills and take Abilities from the Advanced Hauler Tree p. 42.",

    "description": "The Union runs on the backbone of Salvagers who come from all walks of life. This gives them a wide breadth of knowledge which they use to support the Salvage Union. An average day for a Salvager may see them out in the wastes, salvaging scrap in the morning, welding together broken Mechs in the afternoon, and hacking into the corpo-net in the evening. Play a Salvager if you want to be a jack of all trades who can draw from multiple different Abilities as suits your play style. Salvagers can take a maximum of 12 Pilot Abilities, and can choose Abilities from any of the Core Ability trees from any Class. However they cannot advance into any of the Hybrid Classes, nor do they have any Advanced or Legendary Abilities.",

Union Soldiers join from many avenues of life. Some are veterans of past wars, some are wastelanders who have earned their stripes by simply surviving out there, others defect from corpo merc life to the better one the Unions can provide. What they all have in common is a desire to fight for the Salvage Union which has provided them and their community with so much. Play a Soldier if you want to play a combat focused character who can blow things up, engage in brutal melee combat, and survive out in the hostile wastes.
