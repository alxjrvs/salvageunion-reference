When activated, this Module projects a life-like, three dimensional, hologram into an area within Range. The hologram appears to onlookers as though it was realistic and can be viewed from multiple angles. It can be spoken through or set to repeat a message, make animal calls, or mimic the sounds of explosions or weapons firing. The hologram can have any appearance that you choose and can be either Mech or Pilot-sized. The hologram stays in place within the location you set for 24 hours.",
