There are six Tech Levels of Scrap broadly representing the rarity, value, and complexity of the components. Scrap is used as a form of barter based currency and can be used to craft and repair Mech Chassis, Systems, and Modules. Scrap takes up 1 Cargo Slot on a Mech and 3 Inventory Slots on a Pilot.",
