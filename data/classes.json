They can take apart and put back together a Mech Chassis in the blink of an eye, and keep their salvage crew operational out in the wastes.

Engineers can advance into the Fabricator p. 62 or Union Rep Class p. 74, or focus their talents and take Abilities from the Advanced Engineer Tree p. 30.",

This can-do attitude makes them a shoo-in for leadership roles, as other salvagers look up to them for their sheer tenacity. Play a Hauler if you want to play a hardy character who can haul large amounts of cargo, make tough deals, and protect and inspire their allies.

Play a Salvager if you want to be a jack of all trades who can draw from multiple different Abilities as suits your play style. Salvagers can take a maximum of 12 Pilot Abilities, and can choose Abilities from any of the Core Ability trees from any Class.
